EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE STATEMENT:

CipherSim is a tool designed to teach cybersecurity concepts through safe,
offline simulations. It demonstrates password security principles, hashing
algorithms, attack techniques, and defensive strategies in a controlled
educational environment.

The tool includes multiple safeguards to prevent misuse:
- Offline-only operation (no network capabilities)
- Demo data only (no real credentials)
- Prominent ethical warnings
- Educational focus throughout

Users are expected to:
- Learn about password security
- Understand cryptographic principles
- Recognize attack patterns
- Implement proper defenses
- Use knowledge to BUILD secure systems, not to BREAK them

REMEMBER: With great knowledge comes great responsibility. Use this tool
ethically and legally. If in doubt, don't do it.
